# The Climb Times (mongoScraper)

![image of Climb Times Site](/public/climbtimes-example.PNG)

##Overview

The Climb Times is an application that scrapes rock climbing articles from the New York Times. Each scraped article should be saved to a database. When run you should be able to see the following information for each article:

*Headline
*Summary
*Link to the article
*Article Photo

Ideally users should be able to leave a comment on the article of their choosing. The comments would then be saved to the database with the ability to be revisited should further editing need to be done. 

###Issues

Unfortunately the site is not currently functional as it needs further coding to connect the client-side with the server-side.

*Express NPM Package
